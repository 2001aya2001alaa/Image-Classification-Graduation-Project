# Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model for classifying images of birds, cats, dogs, hamsters, and turtles.  

- The purpose of the model is to accurately classify new images of these animals, which can be used for a variety of applications such as animal identification, wildlife conservation, and pet detection.

- To accomplish this goal, we will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is very effective for image classification tasks. We will use the Keras library in Python to build and train the model, and we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

- In addition to training the model, we will also perform data augmentation techniques. We will also use transfer learning to leverage a pre-trained CNN model on a large dataset to extract features from the images, which can help improve the performance of our model.

# The Dataset
- The dataset used for this project consists of birds, cats, dogs, hamsters, and turtles images. Each image is 256 x 256 pixels in size and is in JPEG format. 

- The images were collected from various sources on the internet.  

- To improve the performance of the machine learning model, we applied various preprocessing techniques to the images, such as resizing, cropping, and normalizing the pixel values. We also used data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to create new variations of the images and increase the size of the training set.

- The dataset is provided in a compressed file format and can be easily loaded into Python using the Keras library. The code for loading and preprocessing the dataset is included in the project repository.
