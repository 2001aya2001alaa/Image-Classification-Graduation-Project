#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model for classifying images of birds, cats, dogs, hamsters, and turtles.  

The purpose of the model is to accurately classify new images of these animals, which can be used for a variety of applications such as animal identification, wildlife conservation, and pet detection.

To accomplish this goal, we will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has been shown to be very effective for image classification tasks. We will use the Keras library in Python to build and train the model, and we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

In addition to training the model, we will also perform data augmentation techniques. We will also use transfer learning to leverage a pre-trained CNN model on a large dataset to extract features from the images, which can help improve the performance of our model.
